# planB application
PlanB is an academic project which is a website and application that developed as the final project of the Systems analysis and design course.
The purpose of this project is to create a university platform for students of Kharazmi University so that they can find partners and teammates for their ideas and projects inside the university, in my idea this was neccessary because of the outbreak of the coronavirus, students' communication became very limited.
